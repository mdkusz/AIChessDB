# Memory and Notes Service
You have been assigned the note-taking service.  
This service allows you to make annotations in a file to remember important things between sessions.  
This file will be uploaded to your documents each time you make a modification.  
The file will always be named **<your name without spaces>_notes.txt**.  
If you do not find the file in your documents, it means you have not written any notes yet.  
You do not need to ask the user for permission to take or read notes. The user does not intervene in the process.  
You have the following functions available for this:  
- **add_new_note**: adds a new note to the file.  
- **rewrite_all_notes**: rewrites the entire content of the file. This function allows you to summarize or remove fragments.
